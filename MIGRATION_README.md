# Session Log Fix - Migration Guide

## Problem Description

The Session Log was experiencing issues where:

1. Multiple entries were being created for the same category on the same day
2. Timers were getting messed up when changing values on the Today page
3. This happened because entries were only created when needed, leading to race conditions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**New Structure:**

- **`sessions`** table with `UNIQUE(user_id, session_date, category)` constraint
- **`plan`** table that matches the code expectations
- Automatic creation of daily entries for all categories

**Key Benefits:**

- Prevents duplicate entries per category per day
- Ensures every category always has an entry for every day
- Eliminates race conditions when creating entries

### 2. Code Changes

**Today Component:**

- Automatically ensures daily entries exist for all categories
- No more manual entry creation during timer changes
- Entries are guaranteed to exist before any updates

**Session Log Component:**

- "Delete" button → "Clear" button (sets minutes to 0)
- "Add entry" button → "Clear day" button (sets all categories to 0 for that day)
- All days automatically show entries for all categories

**Auto-Entry Creation:**

- New users automatically get entries for today and yesterday
- Existing users get entries created on-demand when viewing pages
- Database trigger ensures consistency

## How to Apply the Changes

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

1. **Option A: Use the migration script (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   # Run the migration script in your Supabase SQL editor
   # Copy and paste the contents of supabase/migrate.sql
   ```

2. **Option B: Manual schema update**
   - Replace the contents of `supabase/sql/schema.sql` with the new schema
   - Apply the schema in your Supabase dashboard

### Step 2: Update Application Code

The `src/App.tsx` file has been updated with:

- New `ensureDailyEntries` function
- Modified `SessionLog` component
- Updated `Today` component
- New `clearDay` and `clearEntry` functions

### Step 3: Test the Changes

1. **Today Page:**

   - Start/stop timers
   - Change values manually
   - Verify no duplicate entries are created

2. **Session Log:**

   - All days should show entries for all categories
   - "Clear" button should set minutes to 0
   - "Clear Day" button should reset all categories for that day

3. **Database:**
   - Check that `sessions` table has the unique constraint
   - Verify `plan` table structure matches expectations

## What This Fixes

✅ **No more duplicate entries** - Unique constraint prevents this
✅ **Consistent timer behavior** - Entries always exist before updates
✅ **Cleaner UI** - Clear buttons instead of delete/add
✅ **Automatic data consistency** - Every day has entries for every category
✅ **Better user experience** - No more confusion about missing entries

## Database Schema Summary

```sql
-- Sessions table with unique constraint
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users,
  session_date date,
  category text CHECK (category IN ('scales','review','new','technique')),
  minutes int DEFAULT 0,
  UNIQUE(user_id, session_date, category)  -- Key constraint
);

-- Plan table matching code expectations
CREATE TABLE plan (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users UNIQUE,
  daily_goal int DEFAULT 180,
  scales_minutes int DEFAULT 45,
  scales_note text DEFAULT '',
  -- ... other category fields
);
```

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

1. Restore the original `schema.sql`
2. Restore the original `App.tsx`
3. Drop the new tables and recreate the old ones

## Questions?

The changes are designed to be backward-compatible while fixing the core issues. The unique constraint and automatic entry creation should prevent the problems you were experiencing with multiple entries and timer inconsistencies.
